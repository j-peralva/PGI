# PGI
This repository is for sharing solutions of old homeworks of Programming with Graphical Interfaces discipline of CEDERJ

## Considerations:
These Python files are not written in Pythonic way. Professor asked us to use Doxygen to generate documentation and this destroyed the code. I plan to refactor the code in future to a pythonic code.
